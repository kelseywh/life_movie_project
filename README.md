# life_movie_project
# Project started 2/2013 for Andy Connolly as undergrad RA in HaxbyLab
# Takes input from annotation files (4 parts = 4 annotation files) from Life Movie clips by Kelsey and Easha
# Uses WordNet (Princeton) to define annotations and find hypernyms of annotation features.

# Create matrix of zeros. If a feature is present at a timepoint, update that feature in the matrix to "1" for that timepoint. Repeat for all 4 parts of Life Movie.
